    "### what is oops?\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of designing and organizing software where data and behaviors (functions) are grouped into objects. It helps in organizing code by using real-world concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
    "### EXPLAIN PROGRAMMING PARADIGM ?\n",
    "- it is a way or style of writing computer program.\n",
    "- it is as  different approches to solving problems with code.\n",
    "###### EXAMPLES:\n",
    "- procederal programming - focuses on writing step by step instructions \n",
    "- oop - focuses on organizuing code into objcts that represents real world things\n",
    "- functional programming - focuses on writng code using functions that avoid changing data "

    "- Def &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A programming style where the program is built as a sequence of steps or instructions \n",
    "- Focus &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;focuses on function and the sequence of actions \n",
    "- Data and function &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data and function are seprate\n",
    "- Modularity &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; programs are divided into function\n",
    "- Data security &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data is usually global and share among functions, making it less secure.\n",
    "- Reusability &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code reusability is limited functioins need to be re written for new use cases.\n",
    "- Scalability &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harder to manage and scale as the program grows larger. \n",
    "- Example &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;language C , fortan \n",
    "- Real-world modeling &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difficult to model real world entities \n",
    "- flexibility &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adding new functionality can be complex \n",
    "- Example in code &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a function can calculate the area of triangle area(length , width) \n",

    "- Data and function &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = &nbsp;&nbsp; data and function are combined into object.\n",
    "- Modularity &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = programs are divided into classes and object.\n",
    "- Data security &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= data is hidden using encapsulation making it more secure .\n",
    "- Reusability&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = promotes code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism.\n",

    "Modularity is a software design principle that involves breaking down a system or program into smaller, independent, and manageable parts called modules.\n",
    "- ## scalability:\n",
    "Scalability in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the ability of a software system to handle growth effectively, either by managing increasing amounts of data or by adding new features without requiring major changes to the existing code.\n",
    "- ## data security:\n",
    "data security means keeping the data inside a class safe by controlling who can see or change it, using tools like private variables and public methods."
